# ==============================================================================
# DETAILED EXPLANATION OF CONFIGURATIONS
# ==============================================================================
#
# --- [alias] (Shortcuts) ---
# lg : Displays a sophisticated graphical history
#      - Show the tree structure (--graph)
#      - Uses color codes (blue for the hash, green for the relative date)
#      - Displays the author and references (branches/tags)
#
# --- [color] ---
# ui = auto : Enables syntax highlighting in the terminal for better readability.
#
# --- [commit] ---
# verbose = true : Displays the "diff" (the changes) at the bottom of the commit message
#                  in the editor, to verify what you are committing.
#
# --- [core] (System Settings) ---
# autocrlf = true : Handles line breaks Windows (CRLF) vs Linux/Mac (LF).
#                   Converts to LF on commit, and to CRLF on checkout (essential under Windows).
# editor : Sets VS Code as the default editor
#          The '--wait' option forces the terminal to wait for the file to close.
# excludesfile : Path to a global .gitignore file (to ignore files on ALL your projects).
#
# --- [fetch] ---
# prune = true : Automatically removes remote branches from your local list
#                that have been deleted on the server (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).
#
# --- [help] ---
# autocorrect = 20 : If you make a typo (e.g., 'git stats'), Git waits 2.0 seconds
#                    (20 tenths) and then automatically executes the correct command.
#
# --- [init] ---
# defaultBranch = main : Use 'main' instead of 'master' when creating a new repository (`git init`).
#
# --- [push] ---
# autoSetupRemote = true : Allows you to perform a 'git push' on a new branch without having to
#                          type the command '--set-upstream origin <branch-name>'.
#
# --- [rerere] (Reuse Recorded Resolution) ---
# enabled = true : If you resolve a merge conflict, Git remembers it. If the same conflict
#                  occurs later, Git will automatically apply your solution.
#
# --- [tag] ---
# sort = version:refname : Sorts tags in an "intelligent" way (e.g., v1.10 will appear AFTER v1.2,
#                          instead of a purely alphabetical sort).
#
# --- [include] ---
# Identity [user] is loaded dynamically from the [.gitconfig.local] file above.
